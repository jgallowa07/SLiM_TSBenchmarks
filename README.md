This Git Repo Contains the the benchmark simulation to give basic time profiling to our pedigree recording implimentation.

Bench - 

  Contains all benchmark profiles

  Optimizations
	
	This contains the same time profile after different optimizations

	Size = 10000 Rho = 10000

	First Optimization - 

		Neutral Run

		With Naive Implimentation
		Compared to Neutral   


  Profiles

  	Once our code has been optimized, we will run a slew of simulations across 	
	a range of size and rho values, this will contain those simulation profiles
